# Gravity Simulator
An application simulating the motion of bodies subject to the law of universal gravitation.

## Motivation
This project was created on March 1 with the aim of using my knowledge of physics to create a gravity simulator and learn how to compute real-life situations. 

## Description
It is possible to add a body anywhere on the screen with left-click. Once the start button is selected, the simulation is playing. It is possible to stop the animation with the pause button or to restart with the stop button. When two bodies collide, they are disintegrated.

Display is made possible by the pygame module and Pyinstaller was used to compile the Python file into an executable file ( .exe ).
Futur additions will include some sound effects.

## Technologies
<b>Build with: </b>
- Python 3.10.1 64-bit
- Module Pygame 2.5.0
- Pyinstaller 4.7
